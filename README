Code walkthrough:

#### Cleaning

01_Phage_Confidence_Filtering: Phage identification pipeline (merging phage datasets, confidence filtering.

02_dRep: Incorporating dereplication information.

03_funcCleaning: Merging functional analysis of phage (PHROGS & COG hits), identifying phage-associated proteins, estimating intactness, identifying putative antifungal genes.

#### Prophage Distribution Analyses
04a_descStats: Calculating min/median/max of number of amphibian prophage and prophage composition for total predicted and intact prophage. 

04b_descStats: Calculating min/median/max of number of Janthinobacterium prophage and prophage composition for total predicted and intact prophage. 

05a_distrbGraphs: Analysis & statistics related to amphibian prophage distribution across genera.

05b_distrbGraphs: Analysis & statistics related to Janthinobacterium prophage distribution across genera.

06_taxonomy: Classifying taxonomic families of phage. For code on how taxonomy was collected, see: https://github.com/scubalaina/phage_ref_ani_aai

#### Functional Annotation
07a_IndivFunc: Distribution of gene functional catagories for amphibian prophages.

07b_IndivFunc: Distribution of gene functional catagories for Janthinobacterium prophages.

08_chitinTree: Phylogenetic tree of putative chitinase-like proteins.

09_compositeFigs: Code to create Figure 5 using 05b and 07b analyses.
